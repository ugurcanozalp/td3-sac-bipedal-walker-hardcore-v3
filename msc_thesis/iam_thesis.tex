%%% Verbatim/Listings Environments
%%%
% In most cases, we need to present coding/listing of Matlab or Python
% or other programming languages.
% Unfortunately, lstlistings does not work metu_iam.cls !!!
% It is better to use a workaround instead:
%
%%% Suggestion: minted.sty (however not default here, due to the following.)
%%% HERE IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO FIRST: 
%%% You must invoke LaTeX with the -shell-escape flag;
%%% and you need to have python as well as pigments installed.
%uncomment%   \usepackage[newfloat]{minted} % This package supports many languages (and their color schema). 
% if you are using linux, no problem (in most cases)
% if you are using Windows, then
% 1. download and install Python for Windows on https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
% 2. open a command prompt in Windows and run on the prompt (C:\Users\yourname>)
%   (a) python -m pip install -U pip setuptools
%   (b) easy_install pygments
%    make sure that the executables are reachable within the PATH environment variable
% 3. restart Windows
% Now minted package can be used. 
% Beware: -shell-escape flag must be used when latex or pdflatex compiler is invoked.
% Also, if you decide to use minted comment the definition of the listing environment below
%
%%% Alternative Approach (however without colours) is
%%% to use Verbatim Environment
% for this Template for instance we define,
% similar to the 'listing' environment in minted.sty :)
% if you don't want to use this new environment, 
% or, if you are using minted.sty, you should/must comment the lines:
%comment%   
\DeclareFloatingEnvironment[fileext=lol,placement=tbp]{listing}
%comment%   
\newcommand{\listingscaption}{Listing}
 %\floatname{listing}{\listingscaption} % if float, instead of newfloat, is loaded
%\newcommand{\listoflistingscaption}{List of Listings} % will never be used
%\providecommand{\listoflistings}{\listof{listing}{\listoflistingscaption}}  % will never be used
%
%%% End of Verbatim/Listing Environments
